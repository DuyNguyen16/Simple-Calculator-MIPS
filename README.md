# MIPS Assembly Language Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator implemented in MIPS assembly language using the QtSpim simulator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements

- QtSpim: A simulator for the MIPS assembly language.
- Basic understanding of MIPS assembly language.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download and install QtSpim from the [official website](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.

### Running the Calculator

1. Open QtSpim.
2. Load the `mips_calculator.asm` file into QtSpim.
3. Run the program by clicking the "Run" button.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two integers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one integer from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two integers.
- **Division**: Divides one integer by another, providing both quotient and remainder.

## Usage

Upon running the calculator, you will select an operation and be prompted to enter two integers. The result of the operation will be displayed in the console.
